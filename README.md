   # Tutorial: fleetpro-fleetmanagement

This project is a web application for **managing vehicle fleets** (like trucks) and handling **wholesale financing** for dealerships.
It allows users to view vehicle details, track trips, manage maintenance, monitor alerts, log costs, and also handle dealership credit lines and financed inventory.
The app structure uses **React** for building *pages* and *components*, with data managed in the main application state, mimicking a real backend interaction.
