# Chapter 1: Pages

Welcome to the FleetPro fleet management tutorial! We're starting with the fundamental concept of **Pages**.

Imagine you're building a house. Each room serves a different purpose: the living room for relaxing, the kitchen for cooking, and the bedroom for sleeping. In our application, **Pages** are like those rooms. They represent different sections of our fleet management application, like a page for viewing vehicles, a page for managing drivers, or a dashboard showing key metrics.

**Why Pages?**

Think about a central use case: A fleet manager wants to quickly see all their vehicles. Without pages, we'd have to cram *everything* onto one screen, making it cluttered and confusing. Pages allow us to organize the application into logical sections, each focused on a specific task or set of information.

**What is a Page?**

A **Page** is essentially a React component that represents a specific route or section of the application. It's responsible for:

*   Fetching the necessary data for that section.
*   Arranging the components to display the data.
*   Handling user interactions specific to that section.
*   Being associated to a URL.

Let's break down these key concepts:

1.  **React Component:** If you're new to React, think of a component as a reusable building block for your user interface. It encapsulates the logic and display for a specific part of your application. We will discuss this in detail in [React Components](03_react_components.md).

2.  **Fetching Data:** Each page often needs to retrieve data from somewhere (e.g., a database, an API). The page component is responsible for making this request and storing the data for use.

3.  **Arranging Components:** A page acts like a container, deciding *how* to display information. It might use various components (like tables, charts, or forms) to present the data in a user-friendly way.

4.  **Handling User Interactions:**  Pages react to what the user does. Clicking a button, filling out a form â€“ these interactions are managed within the page component.

5.  **Associated to a URL:** A URL like `/vehicles` or `/drivers` tells the application which page to display. This connection is managed through a process called "routing," which we'll cover in [Routing (React Router)](02_routing__react_router_.md).

**Use Case: Viewing the Dashboard**

Let's say we want to display a dashboard with key fleet metrics, such as the total number of vehicles, the number of active vehicles, and the number of drivers. Here's how a page helps:

1.  We create a `DashboardPage` React component.
2.  `DashboardPage` fetches the total number of vehicles, number of active vehicles, and the total number of drivers.
3.  `DashboardPage` uses `StatCard` components to neatly display each metric.
4. We route the `DashboardPage` to the `/dashboard` URL.

Here's a simplified example of what the `DashboardPage` component might look like:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

function DashboardPage() {
  // Simulate fetching data
  const totalVehicles = 100;
  const activeVehicles = 75;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Fleet Dashboard</h1>
      <p>Total Vehicles: {totalVehicles}</p>
      <p>Active Vehicles: {activeVehicles}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default DashboardPage;
```

This simple code is a React component (`DashboardPage`). Inside, we "fetch" some data (in this case, we're just hardcoding the numbers for simplicity). Then, we use JSX (a syntax extension to JavaScript) to define how the data is displayed on the screen. When the user goes to the `/dashboard` URL (after setting up routing which we will cover in the next chapter), this page will be rendered.

**Example Pages in FleetPro**

Let's look at some real examples from the `fleetpro-fleetmanagement` project. These examples use more advanced features, but the basic principle is the same: each page is a React component responsible for a specific section of the application.

*   **`pages/DashboardPage.tsx`:** This page displays the overall fleet status, including key metrics and recent activity. Here's a simplified snippet:

    ```tsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { TruckIcon } from '../constants';

    interface DashboardPageProps {
      vehicles: any[]; // Simplified for brevity
    }

    const DashboardPage: React.FC<DashboardPageProps> = ({ vehicles }) => {
      const totalVehicles = vehicles.length;

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Fleet Dashboard</h1>
          <p>Total Vehicles: {totalVehicles}</p>
          {/*  Skipping: More complex stats and UI elements */}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default DashboardPage;
    ```

    Here, the page gets its data (`vehicles`) through its `props`, which will be explained in [React Components](03_react_components.md). It then calculates and displays the total number of vehicles.

*   **`pages/DriversPage.tsx`:** This page allows you to manage drivers, including adding, editing, and deleting driver information.

    ```tsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import { Driver } from '../types';

    interface DriversPageProps {
      drivers: Driver[];
    }

    const DriversPage: React.FC<DriversPageProps> = ({ drivers }) => {
      // Skipping: State management and UI elements for brevity

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Manage Drivers</h1>
           {/* Skipping: Driver list and add/edit/delete functionality */}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default DriversPage;
    ```

    This page focuses on managing a list of drivers. It receives driver data as a `prop` and uses state management (`useState`) to handle user interactions like adding and deleting drivers.

*   **`pages/VehiclesPage.tsx`:** This page is used to manage vehicles, including adding, editing, and deleting vehicle information.

    ```tsx
    import React from 'react';

    interface VehiclesPageProps {
      vehicles: any[];
    }

    const VehiclesPage: React.FC<VehiclesPageProps> = ({ vehicles }) => {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Manage Vehicles</h1>
                {/* Skipping: Vehicle list and add/edit/delete functionality */}
            </div>
        );
    }

    export default VehiclesPage;
    ```

    The `VehiclesPage.tsx` manages vehicle-related functionalities such as listing and editing. Similar to the `DriversPage.tsx`, this page uses props to receive its data.

**In Summary:**

Pages are React components that represent different sections or routes in our application. They fetch data, arrange components for display, handle user interactions, and are associated with specific URLs.

Now that we understand the concept of Pages, let's explore how these pages are connected and how navigation between them works in the next chapter: [Routing (React Router)](02_routing__react_router_.md).
